For this exercise, you should modify the SubKiller game from Subsection 6.4.4.
You can start with the existing source code, from the file SubKiller.java. 
Modify the game so it keeps track of the number of hits and misses and displays
these quantities. That is, every time the depth charge blows up the sub, the 
number of hits goes up by one. Every time the depth charge falls off the bottom
of the screen without hitting the sub, the number of misses goes up by one. There 
is room at the top of the panel to display these numbers. To do this exercise, 
you only have to add a half-dozen lines to the source code. But you have to figure
 out what they are and where to add them. To do this, you'll have to read the 
 source code closely enough to understand how it works.
