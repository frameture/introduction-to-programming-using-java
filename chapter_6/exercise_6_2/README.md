Write a program that shows a small red square and a small blue square. 
The user should be able to drag either square with the mouse. (You'll need an 
instance variable to remember which square the user is dragging.) The user can 
drag one square out of the panel if she wants; if she does this, there is no 
way to get it back. The other square should be limited in the drawing area - 
cannot leave the borders.

Note that for this exercise, you should do all the drawing in the paintComponent() 
method (as indeed you should whenever possible).
