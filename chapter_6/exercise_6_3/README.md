Write a program that shows a pair of dice. When the user clicks on the panel in 
the program, the dice should be rolled (that is, the dice should be assigned 
newly computed random values). Each die should be drawn as a square showing 
from 1 to 6 dots. Since you have to draw two dice, its a good idea to write
a subroutine, "void drawDie(Graphics g, int val, int x, int y)", to draw 
a die at the specified (x,y) coordinates. The second parameter, val, 
specifies the value that is showing on the die.
