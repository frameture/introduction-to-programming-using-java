 In Exercise 3.8, you drew a checkerboard. For this exercise, write a program
 where the user can select a square by clicking on it. (Use a JPanel for the 
 checkerboard.) Highlight the selected square by drawing a colored border 
 around it. When the program starts, no square is selected. When the user 
 clicks on a square that is not currently selected, it becomes selected (and
 the previously selected square, if any, is unselected). If the user clicks 
 the square that is selected, it becomes unselected.
