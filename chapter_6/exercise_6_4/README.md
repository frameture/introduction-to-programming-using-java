In Exercise 6.3, you wrote a pair-of-dice panel where the dice are rolled when 
the user clicks on the panel. Now make a pair-of-dice program in which the user 
rolls the dice by clicking a button. The button should appear under the panel 
that shows the dice. Also make the following change: When the dice are rolled, 
instead of just showing the new value, show a short animation during which the 
values on the dice are changed in every frame. The animation is supposed to make 
the dice look more like they are actually rolling.
