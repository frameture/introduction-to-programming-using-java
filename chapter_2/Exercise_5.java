/** If you have N eggs, then you have N/12 dozen eggs, with N%12 eggs left 
 * over. (This is (solution)essentially the definition of the / and % operators
 * for integers.) Write a program that asks the user how many eggs she has and 
 * then tells the user how many dozen eggs she has and how many extra eggs are
 * left over. A gross of eggs is equal to 144 eggs. Extend your program so that
 * it will tell the user how many gross, how many dozen, and how many left over
 * eggs she has. For example, if the user says that she has 1342 eggs, then your
 * program would respond with:
 * 
 * Your number of eggs is 9 gross, 3 dozen, and 10 since 1342 is equal 
 * to 9*144 + 3*12 + 10.
