  <h3>
      Repository contains exercises and assignments written as a practise on 
	  <a href='http://math.hws.edu/javanotes/'>Introduction to Programming Using Java</a>
	  <br>textbook written by <a href='http://math.hws.edu/eck/'>Professor David J. Eck</a>
  </h3>
  <p>It was pleasure to follow this textbook and understand Professor's Eck point of view on programming.</p>
  <p>Would highly recommend to anyone willing to understand all fundamental concepts of programming.</p>
  <p>Eck also introduces its readers to several advanced topics like multithreading, 'Big-Oh notation' and advanced Input/Output.</p>
  
  <p>Note: I have been going through this book for six months: jan-jun 2016. As I 
     found out about GitHub in August, I started to upload gradually my solutions
	 for the exercises, nonetheless my initial solutions don't satisfy me, hence
	 I have to refactor and comment almost every exercise. That takes time, and
	 in meantime I was also learning Android and web develeopment.
