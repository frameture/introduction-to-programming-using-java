  The game of Go Moku (also known as Pente or Five Stones) is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe, 
  except that it is played on a much larger board and the object is to get five 
  squares in a row rather than three. Players take turns placing pieces on a board. 
  A piece can be placed in any empty square. The first player to get five pieces 
  in a row -- horizontally, vertically, or diagonally -- wins. If all squares 
  are filled before either player wins, then the game is a draw. Write a program 
  that lets two players play Go Moku against each other.
