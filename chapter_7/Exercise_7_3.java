/** In Subsection 7.4.4, it is mentioned that the standard sorting method 
  * Arrays.sort() is much faster and efficient than selection sort. Write 
  * a program to test this claim. To be specific, your program should create 
  * a large array filled with random real numbers. It should use both Arrays.sort() 
  * and selectionSort() to sort the array, and it should time how long it takes 
  * to perform each sort. Furthermore, it should do the same thing for a large 
  * array of random Strings. To find the times, you can use System.currentTimeMillis()
