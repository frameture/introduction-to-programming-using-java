Write the PairOfDice class in which the instance variables die1 and die2 are private.
Your class will need "getter" methods that can be used to find out the values of die1 and die2.
(The idea is to protect their values from being changed from outside the class, but still 
to allow the values to be read.) Include other improvements in the class, including at least 
a toString() method. Test your class with a short program that counts how many times a pair 
of dice is rolled, before the total of the two dice is equal to two.
