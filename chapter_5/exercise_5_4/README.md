 Write a program to test the BlackjackHand class. You should create a BlackjackHand 
 object and a Deck object. Pick a random number between 2 and 6. Deal that many cards
 from the deck and add them to the hand. Print out all the cards in the hand, and 
 then print out the value computed for the hand by getBlackjackValue(). 
 Repeat this as long as the user wants to continue.
