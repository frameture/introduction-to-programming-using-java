  Write a class to represent Roman numerals. The class should have two constructors. 
  One constructs a Roman numeral from a string such as "XVII" or "MCMXCV". It 
  should throw a NumberFormatException if the string is not a legal Roman numeral. 
  The other constructor constructs a Roman numeral from an int. It should throw 
   a NumberFormatException if the int is outside the range 1 to 3999.
  
  In addition, the class should have two instance methods. The method toString() 
  returns the string that represents the Roman numeral. The method toInt() returns 
  the value of the Roman numeral as an int.
