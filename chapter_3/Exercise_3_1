/**
 * 
 * How many times do you have to roll a pair of dice before they come up snake eyes?
 * You could do the experiment by rolling the dice by hand. Write a computer program 
 * that simulates the experiment. The program should report the number of rolls that
 * it makes before the dice come up snake eyes. (Note: "Snake eyes" means that both 
 * dice show a value of 1.) Exercise 2.2 explained how to simulate rolling a pair of
 * dice.
